# Dynamic Pricing Project
This project predicts weekly sales for a retail chain using Python, helping to optimize pricing strategies. It includes data analysis, feature engineering, and a Linear Regression model.

## Key Findings
- High demand significantly increases sales, suggesting price increases during these periods.
- Sales are higher during holidays and the holiday season (Nov-Dec).
- Temperature has a small impact, with mild temperatures linked to the highest sales.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`.
3. Run `dynamic_pricing.py`.
